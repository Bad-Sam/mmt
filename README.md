# mmt (managed memory tools)
A small collections of functions and allocators to help manage allocated memory and reduce memory allocations

## A list of available allocators
- [mem_arena](`mmt/src/allocators/mem_arena.h`): a chunk of pre-allocated memory, from which memory can only be requested, not given back
- [mem_stack](`mmt/src/allocators/mem_stack.h`): manages a memory block populated with data type(s) of the same size, which can be allocated and freed
- [mem_pool](`mmt/src/allocators/mem_pool.h`): manages a memory block from which memory can be allocated and released in arbitrary size, in the same way a stack would
